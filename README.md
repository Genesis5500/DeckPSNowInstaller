**What this script does:**
1. Checks for PSPlus files and needed DLL
2. Downloads and extracts to HOME
3. Sets Steam shortcut for application

**Things to Note**
1. You may have to sign in twice, not sure the reasoning for this
2. Once started, controller support should look like a Console & Controller icon in the top right hand corner of the sceen
3. Keep clicking this using the touchpad until it responds, full-screen may work as well this way

**Huge Shoutout to https://www.youtube.com/@SteamDeckGaming & the creators of Lutris for making this possible!**
